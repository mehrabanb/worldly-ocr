# LaTeX-based pipeline for sampling fonts

In this folder we use several tools (freely available on Linux platforms)
to generate text samples in system-accessible fonts.

In this example we use a TTF font called "Lunafreya" available from
[www.datafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/lunafreya.font).


# The produced sample

The sample below is the result of running the tools, and it creates an English cursive
script sample, with some slant. It can be used as the "easy" script sample for experimenting
with handwriting and script language OCR.
