The University,s decision to join the University Athletic Associ-
ation is, at first glance, an exciting venture. It seems more
appropriate for the U of C to compete athletically against uni-
versities they compete with lnte'llectually. Aore meaningful riv-
alries can be built around schools with which the student body is
already familiar. And if the concept of a rival athletic s   `hool
catches on, the quality of student life on campus will be improved by
this new diversion. Aore high school students will hear of the
University of Chicago. This leads to more and better applicants to
the college' and a larger class size. Alumni Associations will be able
to show off a new crop of bright, proinising student-athletes to
alumni hungry for contact with their old college. This leads to more
donations to the school. And with more students paying tuition and
more donations...
