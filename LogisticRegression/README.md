# Implementation of Logistic Regression for OCR

This folder contains a straightforward implementation of Logistic
Regression using MNIST data as the target content. The algorithm is
analyzed in the paper included in this repository.  The paper (http::./patternnet.pdf) is of
interest as it shows that under normal circumstances the logistic
regression algorithm does not require regularization.
