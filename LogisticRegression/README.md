# Implementation of Logistic Regression for OCR

This folder contains a straightforward implementation of Logistic
Regression using MNIST data as the target content. The algorithm is
analyzed in the paper included in this repository.  The paper
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12600](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12600)
explains the underlying theory and should be of interest even to
experts, as it shows by a rigorous mathematical argument that under
normal circumstances the logistic regression algorithm does not
require regularization.
