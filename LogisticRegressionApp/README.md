# A Demo Application in MATLAB
MATLAB has features for creating standalone applications. Applications generated by MATLAB:

- Do not require MATLAB to be installed
- Do not require MATLAB license
- Are cross-platform. Installers can be generated for Linux, Windows and Mac OS, and
other platforms.

## The scope of the demo application
The application in this folder is a GUI application for handwritten digit recognition,
and is a direct port to a GUI environment of the implementation in the folder (../LogisticRegression).

## The installer
Due to file size limitation of 100MB, we are not able to include the installer on GitHub.
The installer is hosted on (http://bitbucket.org) and can be downloaded from here:

(https://bitbucket.org/rychlikjobs/worldly-ocr-installer/src/master/LogisticRegressionApp/for_redistribution/MyAppInstaller_web.install)

Currently we provide only a Linux installer (tested on Fedora 29, but
should work on most Linux platforms.)  It is an incomplete
installer. It comes without the MATLAB redistributable runtime, which
is currently a 2GB download. However, the installer will download the
necessary files as part of the installation process.
